        <p class="blurb">My name is Daniel Douglas and I live in Denver, Colorado.
            I grew up in McGregor, Texas but relocated to Colorado
            in 2004. My hobbies include skiing, golf, hiking, men's softball,
            mountain biking - pretty much anything outdoors! I am a recent graduate of the University of Denverâ€™s
            full stack boot camp and have continued to expand my knowledge base by practicing
            coding challenges as well as fine-tuning applications I built in class.
            I possess a BBA in Management Information Systems from Baylor University but ended up going
            into inside and outside sales positions for the last 13 years. 
            I am so excited to transition back into IT and looking forward to putting my skills into practice.
